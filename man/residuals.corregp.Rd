\title{Extracting Residuals from Correspondence Regression}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{corregp}(object, parm = "all", nf = NULL, ...)

\method{resid}{corregp}(object, parm = "all", nf = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The output of a call to \code{\link{corregp}} (i.e. an object of class "corregp").}

\item{parm}{The parameter for which to extract the residuals. Can be \code{"all"}, \code{"both"} (or abbreviations), \code{"y"} or \code{"x"} for
the residuals of every cell in the data, but it can also be any vector of term names in X or level names in X. Defaults to \code{"all"}.}

\item{nf}{The number of dimensions to be retained in the reduced space. Defaults to all dimensions (no reduction).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A matrix or vector with the residuals for the parameters of interest, based on the selected number of dimensions.
}
\description{
Method to extract the residuals of a correspondence regression.
}
\details{
If all dimensions are retained, then the residuals will only be exactly zero to the observed counts if no conditioning factors were specified with the argument
  \code{"part"} in the \code{\link{corregp}} call. This is because the associations with the conditioning factors (in \code{"part"}) are not taken into
  account.

\examples{
\donttest{
data(HairEye)
haireye.crg <- corregp(Eye ~ Hair * Sex, data = HairEye, b = 3000)
residuals(haireye.crg, parm = c("Hair", "Sex"), nf = 2)
resid(haireye.crg, parm = c("Hair", "Sex"), nf = 2)
